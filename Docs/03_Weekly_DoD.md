# Weekly Definition of Done (DoD) — Arena Combat Battlegrounds

A week is only “done” when ALL items below are complete.
If I’m behind, I cut scope (features), not the DoD.

---

## 1) Code & repo hygiene

- [ ] Changes committed locally AND pushed to remote (once repo exists)
  - [ ] Stored in /Builds/vX.Y/ as a zip
- [ ] Project opens and Play Mode runs without Console Errors (warnings allowed if understood)
- [ ] No “temporary” hacks left without a TODO note
- [ ] Commit messages are meaningful (describe outcome)

## 2) Build & smoke test (Windows)

- [ ] Windows build created (Build zipped and runnable.)
- [ ] Smoke test completed from a clean folder:
  - [ ] Launch build
  - [ ] Start a run
  - [ ] Survive at least 1 wave (or complete the week’s slice test)
  - [ ] Pause → Resume works
  - [ ] Reach Results screen (or Menu if Results not implemented yet)
  - [ ] Quit works

## 3) Release discipline

- [ ] Release notes written (Features / Fixes / Known Issues / Next)
- [ ] Version tagged (vX.Y) OR milestone commit created (if tags aren’t set up yet)

## 4) Documentation (portfolio-facing)

- [ ] README updated (what changed + controls + how to run)
- [ ] Known Issues updated (only real issues; remove fixed ones)

## 5) Portfolio evidence

- [ ] 1 short clip (10–30s) OR 2 screenshots captured
- [ ] Files placed in /Media and named:
  - vX.Y_YYYY-MM-DD_shortdesc

## 6) Personal dev log (learning capture)

- [ ] Notes/DevLog.md updated:
  - What I built (3–6 bullets)
  - What I learned (max 5 bullets)
  - Bugs discovered / fixed
  - Next session plan (top 3)
